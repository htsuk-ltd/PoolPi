# Solar Heater

The concept of the heater is pretty basic. 

Take a lenth of garden hose, form it into a coil, put it in the sun and push some water through it.

I started off with a length of approx 50m of 1/2 inch standard garden hose wound into a loose spiral. To secure the coil so that it would not uncoil I used some metal strapping and fastened the host to it with some wire. This allows you to keep the coil flat and consistent and means you can move it around with some core.

An exposed coil will work just in this configuration, but to improve the efficiency of the energy transfer you want to put the coil in an enclosure.

My frame is approx 90cm x 90cm and has a 12mm OSB board for the base.

The box is primed with spray paint and the coil is then screwed using the metal straps to the base. Two 22mm holes are drilled in the side to allow the flow/return pipes to pass into the enclosure.

A DS18B20 sensor is attached in the middle of the enclosure and runs outsite via the same path as the hose.

Finally a covering is fastened over the top to keep residual heat inside the enclousre. 

** Initially, I only had red-primer and polythene sheet. This has now been replaced with Matt Black paint (including the hose) and a 90x90 cm sollid polycarbonate sheet. **
