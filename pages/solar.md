# Solar Heater

The concept of the heater is pretty basic. 

Take a lenth of garden hose, form it into a coil, put it in the sun and push some water through it.

I started off with a length of approx 50m of 1/2 inch standard garden hose wound into a loose spiral. To secure the coil so that it would not uncoil I used some metal strapping and fastened the hose to it with wire. This allows you to keep the coil flat and consistent and means you can move it around with some care.

An exposed coil will work just in this configuration, but to improve the efficiency of the energy transfer you want to put the coil in an enclosure.

My frame is approx 90cm x 90cm and has a 12mm OSB board for the base.

The box is primed with spray paint and the coil is then screwed using the metal straps to the base. Two 22mm holes are drilled in the side to allow the flow/return pipes to pass into the enclosure.

A DS18B20 sensor is attached in the middle of the enclosure and runs outside via the same path as the hose.

Finally a covering is fastened over the top to keep residual heat inside the enclosure.

** Initially, I only had red-primer and polythene sheet. This has now been finished with Matt Black paint (including the hose) and a 90x90 cm solid polycarbonate sheet. **


The pump is a small 12volt DC submersible type with a 12mm spiggot. This spiggot is fractionally too small for a good friction fit with the hose so a small amount of self amalgamating tape and a spring clip helps secure the hose in place.

The outlet end of the hose is trimmed 150mm shorter than the base of the inlet in an attempt to stop the pump drawing too much of the freshly heated water back into the coil.

A small hole was made in the side of each hose with a soldering iron and a length of wire pushed through and out of the end as a draw-string. 
Each end of the hose then had a DS18B20 sensor tied to the drawstring. The sensor end had a 'bulb' of self amalgamating tape wound around to to form a partial plug when drawn up into the hole.

The sensor cable was then secured with a few wraps of self amalgamating tape to bond with the internal plug forming a waterproof seal.

Note, It is not essential that the joints are water tight. Both of these joints are below the waterlevel of the pool and since the pressure and flow rates of this system are low an imperfect joint is not the end of the world.
