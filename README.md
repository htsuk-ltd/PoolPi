## Splunk Controlled HotTub

This project uses Splunk to control certain features of my Lay-Z-Spa Hottub. 

The main objective was to integrate an element of renewable energy heating (Solar) to suppliment the 2kw electric heating elements and help reduce the cost of keeping my hot tub at the perfect temperature.
